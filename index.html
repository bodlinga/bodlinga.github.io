        <div class="two-col">
          <p>
            I’m a CFD engineer and developer specializing in rotorcraft and high-performance
            computing. I’ve spent over a decade building, extending, and applying high-fidelity
            solvers for the U.S. Department of Defense, NASA, and industry partners—covering
            everything from rotorcraft wake aerodynamics to store-separation and tiltrotor /
            ship-deck interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work bridges numerical methods, GPU performance engineering, and production
            workflows. I enjoy taking complex, legacy CFD ecosystems and turning them into
            robust, performance-portable tools—integrating modern C++, Pybind11, and GPU
            backends while keeping analysts productive and simulations tightly validated
            against wind-tunnel and flight-test data.

            <h3>Performance-Portable Overset Near-Body Solver (CREATE-AV Helios)</h3>
            <p>
              Architect &amp; lead developer of a performance-portable structured
              curvilinear compressible flow solver (G3D) built on Mint/RAJA/Kokkos
              and integrated as a GPU-accelerated near-body component in
              CREATE-AV Helios. The solver supports high-order MUSCL and WENO
              reconstructions, SA-RANS turbulence modeling, and implicit DADI
              time-stepping on single-source CPU/GPU binaries, enabling runtime
              selection of the execution device while using exactly the same code
              path.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core methodology was verified and validated on canonical test
              cases—including transonic inviscid flow over NACA0012, steady and
              unsteady viscous flow over cylinders, turbulent NACA0012, and a
              18M-cell ONERA M6 wing—showing close agreement with experiments
              and legacy codes such as GARFIELD, OVERFLOW, and RAPIDUS, while
              delivering a 37× speedup on a single A100 GPU versus a 64-thread
              CPU socket and about 1.6× faster time-to-converged-drag than the
              current GPU-enabled OVERFLOW implementation for ONERA M6.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building on this foundation, the solver has since been extended
              from single-block to overset multi-block capability and wired into
              Helios’s Pundit overset infrastructure. This allows the same
              performance-portable solver to march overset near-body rotorcraft
              grids on GPUs inside Helios, while the off-body Cartesian solver
              and other participants reuse the existing Helios coupling
              mechanisms with minimal changes to user workflows.

            <h3>GPU-Accelerated OVERFLOW Integration in Helios</h3>
            <p>
              Designed and implemented a GPU-native integration of OVERFLOW into the
              CREATE-AV Helios framework, which couples independent near-body solvers
              to an off-body solver through its Pundit module for automated grid
              motion, hole-cutting, and overset connectivity. The integration exposes
              OVERFLOW as a GPU-accelerated library that Helios can call directly via
              a C++/Pybind11 interface, rather than as a standalone code driven by
              external scripts.
            </p>           
            <p>
              The interface builds a structured “bag” of near-body data that both
              Pundit and the GPU-enabled OVERFLOW routines consume, including grid
              sizes, body and boundary tags, host and device coordinate arrays,
              solution variables, iblanking, connectivity, and per-partition
              <code>gpu_data</code> dictionaries in the exact layout Pundit expects. 
              Pundit and OVERFLOW then operate directly on these
              device pointers, so overset interpolation, boundary-condition updates,
              and time marching all run on the same GPU-resident arrays while Helios
              handles configuration and orchestration from Python. This removes a large
              amount of manual, script-driven glue and turns OVERFLOW into a reusable
              GPU near-body component that can be dropped into different Helios
              workflows with minimal user effort.

            <h3>Automated OVERFLOW Mesh &amp; Input Generation</h3>
            <p><strong>Fully automated overset grid generation workflow for rotor blades in Helios + OVERFLOW.</strong></p>
            <p>
              Built an end-to-end automation pipeline in Helios that sets up OVERFLOW
              near-body inputs for rotor blades, including surface and volume grids
              for the blade, root, and cap, as well as force-integration and solver
              input files. The user either supplies a structured blade surface mesh
              or simply specifies blade definitions (chord, twist, anhedral, sweep
              distributions), in which case the code generates the blade surface mesh
              automatically. Using NASA Chimera Grid Tools under the hood, the script
              sweeps through parameter combinations until it detects high-quality overset
              cap/root surface meshes and then repeats the process to obtain a high-quality blade/root/cap volume grid. Once the grid is accepted, the
              pipeline writes out all OVERFLOW force-integration and solver input
              files ready for Helios. A process that previously required an expert
              doing hours of manual trial-and-error can now be run by a novice with a
              single input file; this workflow has been used to generate volume grids
              for 13 different rotor blade geometries (7AD, CH53-K, TRAM, XC142,
              SpinBlades Black Belt 685, ADM swept, RAH-66, UH60 variants, BERPA,
              CH53-TR) using the same configuration.

            <h3>Mean-Flow Perturbation Stability Analysis in FDL3DI</h3>
            <p>
              Implemented the Mean-Flow Perturbation (MFP) linear-stability framework inside the LES code FDL3DI to analyze how complex 3-D flows respond to small disturbances. 
              The work focused on an aspect-ratio-four, NACA0012 wingtip at Re = 2 × 10^5 and 12° incidence, where strong tip vortices drive induced drag. By embedding MFP directly into the flow 
              solver, we were able to efficiently extract least-stable mode shapes and frequencies in the tip-vortex system, including a dominant mode near the trailing edge and a second region 
              near incipient vortex separation. These results provide practical guidance for future flow-control actuators (e.g., winglets or periodic forcing) by informing where to place them 
              and which frequencies and spatial wavelengths are most effective.

            <h3>High-Fidelity LES of Stair-Step Finlet Geometries for Trailing-Edge Noise Reduction</h3>
            <p>
              The goal of my PhD work was to understand the trailing edge noise reduction mechanisms of bioinspired finlet designs from previous experiments 
              at Virginia Tech. While there have been several numerical studies investigating the noise reduction mechanisms of trailing edge serrations, 
              the high fidelity simulations done to model finlets in this project were the first of its kind. For this project, I pioneered wall-resolved 
              LES of airfoils with finlet fences inspired by owl down feathers. The fence finlets used in the experiment are flushed with the airfoil and rise
              at a very shallow angle from the airfoil. Generating a structured mesh around such a geometry while maintaining a reasonable mesh quality and manageable 
              cell count is nearly impossible. Therefore, alternate geometry configurations were sought for which ‘practical’ meshes (i.e. meshes with manageable grid 
              count and cell aspect ratios, skewness, etc that do not render the numerical algorithm unstable) could be obtained. The fences were modeled as a ‘stair-step’ 
              geometry by varying the height of the fences in discrete steps (as opposed to continuous variation in the experiment model) along the chord. 
              The massively parallel LES code, FDL3DI, was extended to handle 90° corners via automated stair-step edge detection and adaptive filter order, enabling accurate LES on 
              complex geometries. Also, the OpenMP load balancing approach was optimized for the stair-step geometry, cutting simulation wall-clock time by 55 % on a 2 K-core cluster. 
              A Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings solver was validated and applied to the trailing-edge noise-reduction designs. This work was published in Bioinspiration and Biomimetics and the Journal of Sound and Vibration.

            <h3>Rotor-Wake Accuracy Campaign</h3>
            <p>
              A common phenomenon in modern high-fidelity CFD simulations is the breakdown of the primary vortex system into secondary vortices 
              (see figures below). The goal of this research was to investigate the sources of error that cause discrepancies between the predicted 
              and measured vortex system of a two-bladed rotor. We wanted to not only identify the sources of numerical error from the discretized 
              Navier-Stokes equations, but also demonstrate how subtle differences between the geometry in the experiment and simulation could lead 
              to differences in the predicted and measured vortex system. For example, we showed that dissimilarities in the blade pitch angle among 
              the blades in the experiment, if not modelled in the simulations, can result not only in differences in vortex pairing but also in the 
              decay of the secondary vortices. This work was published in three peer-reviewed journals including Physics of Fluids.

            <h3>High-Fidelity LES &amp; Aeroacoustics of Owl-Inspired Airfoils</h3>
            <p>

              LES of airfoils with finlet fences inspired by owl down feathers—demonstrating validated reductions in surface-pressure unsteadiness and 
              far-field noise (greater for taller fences). Farfield noise was shown to decrease due to an increase in the distance between the 
              turbulent kinetic energy in the boundary-layer turbulence and the trailing edge as well as a decrease in the spanwise coherence of the 
              turbulence. This work was published in Bioinspiration and Biomimetics and the Journal of Sound and Vibration.
